## Cypress Learning – Selectors & Viewport

In this stage I practiced Cypress basics.

What I learned:
- How to test the website in different screen sizes (viewport)
- How to find elements using CSS selectors
- Find elements by id, class, tag and attribute
- Work with element lists (first, last, eq)
- Navigate in the DOM (parent, children, siblings)
- Find elements by text using cy.contains()

These exercises helped me understand how Cypress works and how to locate elements in real tests.
